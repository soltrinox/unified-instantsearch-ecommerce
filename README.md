**This project aims to be used by any e-commerce website to bootstrap a search experience powered by Algolia the fastest way possible.**

While you would still have to push your data to Algolia, the goal of Unified InstantSearch E-Commerce is to remove the need to implement front-end logic and be able to start using Algolia as quickly as possible.
